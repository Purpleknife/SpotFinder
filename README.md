# SpotFinder üó∫Ô∏è

SpotFinder is an app that allows users to discover maps depending on their interests: 'Best Dog Parks', 'Best Restaurants in Town', etc. 

This project's goal is to revisit an old project made with Node JS, Express and EJS templates: [Wiki Map](https://github.com/Purpleknife/Wiki-Map), and rebuild it using TypeScript, React JS and Express.

<strong><h3> üìå This project's goals are:</h3></strong>
- Develop my skills in TypeScript.
- Develop my skills in React.
- Learn how to use Leaflet Maps API with React.
- Manage an app that has a lot of features.
