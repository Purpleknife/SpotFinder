# SpotFinder üó∫Ô∏è

SpotFinder is an app that allows users to discover maps depending on their interests: 'Best Dog Parks', 'Best Restaurants in Town', etc. 

This project's goal is to revisit and add more features to an old project made with Node JS, Express and EJS templates: [Wiki Map](https://github.com/Purpleknife/Wiki-Map) + rebuild it using TypeScript, React JS and Express.

<strong><h3> üìå This project's goals were:</h3></strong>
- Develop my skills in TypeScript.
- Develop my skills in React.
- Learn how to use Leaflet Maps API with React.
- Manage an app that has a lot of features.

## ERD
The [ERD](https://github.com/Purpleknife/SpotFinder/blob/master/back-end/ERD%20-%20SpotFinder.png) is in the back-end folder.


## Setup
1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the `.env` files with your correct local information : username, password, database, port + Your `Cloudinary API keys`: 'upload_reset' and 'cloudname' to upload pictures.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i` in both `front-end` and `back-end` folders.
4. `cd back-end` then `npm start` to run the Server, and `cd front-end` to run the App.
5. To reset the database: `npm run db:reset`.
